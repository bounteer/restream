00:00:00,Darryll,"Hi Mike, thanks for taking the time today. I understand you're looking to hire a JavaScript Full Stack Developer for BetSquad. Can you start by giving me an overview of what you're looking for?
"
00:00:15,Mike,"Yeah, absolutely Darryll. So we're at a critical point with BetSquad where we need to expand our engineering team. We're building this social betting platform and we need someone who can really hit the ground running. The main thing is they need to be strong with both React and Node.js - like, that's absolutely non-negotiable.
"
00:00:45,Darryll,"When you say strong with React and Node, what level are we talking about?
"
00:00:52,Mike,"I mean proper expert level. They need to have built production systems with these technologies. We're not looking for someone who's just played around with them. For React specifically, they need to understand hooks inside out, state management - whether that's Redux or Context API, I don't mind, but they need to know how to manage complex state in a real-time application.
"
00:01:20,Darryll,"Real-time application - can you elaborate on that?
"
00:01:25,Mike,"Yeah, so betting platforms are all about real-time data. Odds change constantly, bets need to be placed instantly, users want to see live updates. We're talking WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, that kind of thing. Actually, that's pretty important too - they need to have experience with real-time data handling.
"
00:01:48,Darryll,"Got it. What about the backend side with Node.js?
"
00:01:54,Mike,"They need to be able to build robust APIs, handle high throughput. We get massive spikes during big matches - Champions League finals, World Cup, you name it. The system can't fall over when thousands of users are placing bets simultaneously. Express.js experience is important, RESTful API design, all that good stuff.
"
00:02:20,Darryll,"Makes sense. Now, I noticed you're in the betting industry. Do they need gambling experience?
"
00:02:28,Mike,"Oh, that's absolutely critical actually. I should have mentioned that first. If they haven't worked in gambling, gaming, or at least fintech before, it's going to be really tough. The thing is, our industry has so many specific requirements - compliance, regulations, responsible gambling features. Someone coming from, say, e-commerce is going to have a massive learning curve.
"
00:02:58,Darryll,"What specific gambling experience would be ideal?
"
00:03:04,Mike,"Ideally, they've built betting platforms before. They understand odds calculation, betting markets, how sportsbooks work. But even if they've worked on online casinos, poker platforms, or any real-money gaming, that's good. The key is they understand the regulatory landscape.
"
00:03:26,Darryll,"Speaking of regulations, what compliance knowledge do they need?
"
00:03:32,Mike,"Well, they don't need to be lawyers, but understanding UKGC requirements is really important. We're UK-focused primarily. They should know about KYC - Know Your Customer - AML, anti-money laundering. More importantly, they need to have implemented responsible gambling features before. Things like deposit limits, self-exclusion, reality checks. These aren't nice-to-haves, they're legal requirements.
"
00:04:05,Darryll,"How important is this compliance experience compared to the technical skills?
"
00:04:12,Mike,"Look, if I had to choose between a React expert with no gambling experience and a decent React developer who's worked in betting before, I'd probably lean towards the betting experience. The technical skills can be improved, but understanding our industry takes time. Though ideally, we want both, obviously.
"
00:04:35,Darryll,"Fair enough. What about databases and data management?
"
00:04:41,Mike,"Yeah, they need to be solid with databases. We use PostgreSQL for all our transactional data - bets, user accounts, financial records. This stuff needs to be rock solid, properly ACID compliant. We also use Redis heavily for caching and session management. MongoDB knowledge would be nice for some of our analytics stuff, but it's not essential.
"
00:05:08,Darryll,"How would you prioritize the database skills?
"
00:05:13,Mike,"PostgreSQL is more important than MongoDB for us. Redis knowledge is pretty important too because of the real-time nature of what we do. But I wouldn't reject someone amazing just because they haven't used Redis specifically.
"
00:05:30,Darryll,"What about testing? How important is that?
"
00:05:35,Mike,"Very important, actually. When you're dealing with people's money and regulated software, you can't ship bugs. They need to write tests, understand test-driven development. Jest, React Testing Library - they should be comfortable with these. Especially for testing financial calculations, odds calculations, that kind of thing.
"
00:05:58,Darryll,"What about TypeScript?
"
00:06:02,Mike,"Ah, good question. It would be really nice to have. Type safety is great when you're dealing with financial calculations and complex data structures. But I wouldn't reject a strong candidate just because they haven't used TypeScript. It's more of a nice-to-have. They can learn it on the job if needed.
"
00:06:25,Darryll,"Cloud experience? AWS, Google Cloud?
"
00:06:30,Mike,"Again, nice to have but not critical. We're on AWS, so some AWS experience would help them get up to speed faster. But a good developer can learn cloud platforms. It's not a deal breaker.
"
00:06:48,Darryll,"What about DevOps, CI/CD?
"
00:06:53,Mike,"They should understand it, know how to work with CI/CD pipelines. I don't expect them to be DevOps experts, but they should be comfortable with the concepts. We have a DevOps team, so they don't need to set up pipelines from scratch, but they should understand the deployment process.
"
00:07:15,Darryll,"Docker, containerization?
"
00:07:19,Mike,"Nice to have. Makes local development easier, and it's good if they understand containerization concepts. But again, not a deal breaker. We can teach that.
"
00:07:32,Darryll,"What about mobile development? React Native?
"
00:07:37,Mike,"That would be a bonus, actually. We have a mobile app, and while we have dedicated mobile developers, it's great when full-stack devs can jump in and help. But it's definitely not required. Maybe down the line they could learn it if they're interested.
"
00:08:00,Darryll,"GraphQL experience?
"
00:08:04,Mike,"We're considering moving some of our APIs to GraphQL, so experience would be nice. But we're mostly REST right now, so it's not critical. More of a future-looking skill.
"
00:08:20,Darryll,"What about microservices architecture?
"
00:08:25,Mike,"Good to have. We're moving towards microservices, especially for our betting engine. If they've worked with distributed systems, that's a plus. But if they're strong in other areas, they can learn our architecture.
"
00:08:42,Darryll,"Any other technical skills worth mentioning?
"
00:08:47,Mike,"Oh, payment integration experience would be really valuable. If they've worked with payment gateways, implemented wallet systems, handled secure transactions - that's important in our industry. Not as critical as the gambling experience, but definitely important.
"
00:09:08,Darryll,"What about design tools? Figma, Adobe XD?
"
00:09:14,Mike,"(laughs) Honestly, I don't care about that at all. We have designers. The developers need to implement designs, not create them. If they know their way around Figma to grab assets or check specs, great, but it's really not important.
"
00:09:32,Darryll,"Agile certifications, Scrum Master, anything like that?
"
00:09:38,Mike,"Nah, couldn't care less about certifications. We work in an agile way, but I care more about practical experience than certificates. Someone could have all the certifications and still be terrible at actually working in an agile team.
"
00:09:56,Darryll,"What about blockchain, cryptocurrency knowledge?
"
00:10:02,Mike,"Unless we specifically pivot to crypto betting, which we're not planning right now, it's pretty irrelevant. I mean, it's intellectually interesting, and shows they keep up with tech trends, but it won't help them do the job we need.
"
00:10:20,Darryll,"Game development experience? Unity, Unreal?
"
00:10:25,Mike,"No, that's completely different from what we do. We're not making video games. Betting platforms are more like fintech applications than games. Unity experience would be pretty useless for us.
"
00:10:42,Darryll,"Let me make sure I've got the priorities right. What are your absolute must-haves?
"
00:10:49,Mike,"Right, so the non-negotiables are: strong React and Node.js experience - and I mean properly strong, not just familiar. Modern JavaScript, ES6+ features, async/await, all that. And gambling industry experience - they need to have worked in betting, gaming, or at least fintech before.
"
00:11:15,Darryll,"And the important but not quite deal-breaker skills?
"
00:11:21,Mike,"Real-time data handling, compliance knowledge, payment integration experience. Strong database skills, especially PostgreSQL. Testing experience. Git and version control obviously - that goes without saying really. Oh, and they need to understand security, given we're handling money.
"
00:11:48,Darryll,"And the nice-to-haves?
"
00:11:52,Mike,"TypeScript, AWS experience, Docker, GraphQL, React Native, microservices experience. These would all be bonuses but I wouldn't reject someone without them.
"
00:12:08,Darryll,"And the things that don't really matter?
"
00:12:12,Mike,"Design tools, Agile certifications, blockchain stuff unless we specifically need it, game development experience. These won't impact my decision at all.
"
00:12:26,Darryll,"Perfect. What about soft skills and cultural fit?
"
00:12:32,Mike,"They need to be comfortable in a fast-paced environment. Betting is 24/7, especially during major sporting events. They should be problem solvers, able to debug issues under pressure. Good communication is important - they'll work with compliance, product, customer support. And honestly, some interest in sports or betting helps, though it's not essential.
"
00:13:00,Darryll,"What's the team structure like?
"
00:13:04,Mike,"They'll be joining a team of 8 developers. We've got 3 backend, 3 frontend, and 2 full-stack currently. They'll report to our Tech Lead but work quite autonomously. We're not into micromanagement.
"
00:13:22,Darryll,"Salary range?
"
00:13:25,Mike,"For the right person, we're flexible. Market rate for a senior developer with gambling experience. I'd say £80-100k depending on experience, plus equity. We can go higher for someone exceptional.
"
00:13:42,Darryll,"Remote or office-based?
"
00:13:46,Mike,"Flexible. We're remote-first but have an office in London. Ideally, they'd come in once or twice a week for collaboration sessions, but it's not mandatory. Fully remote is fine for the right candidate.
"
00:14:02,Darryll,"Any specific projects they'd be working on initially?
"
00:14:08,Mike,"Yeah, we're rebuilding our bet slip functionality - it needs to be faster, more intuitive. They'd also help implement new responsible gambling features the UKGC is requiring. And we're planning to add in-play betting for more sports, which is technically challenging with the real-time requirements.
"
00:14:32,Darryll,"Timeline for hiring?
"
00:14:35,Mike,"ASAP, really. But I'd rather wait for the right person than hire quickly and regret it. If we could have someone starting in 6-8 weeks, that would be ideal.
"
00:14:50,Darryll,"Interview process?
"
00:14:53,Mike,"Initial call with you, then a technical interview with me and the tech lead - probably some coding exercises, system design questions. Then a cultural fit interview with the wider team. Maybe a take-home test if we're unsure, but I prefer to avoid those if possible. 
"
00:15:15,Darryll,"Great. Any questions for me?
"
00:15:20,Mike,"What's the market like for developers with gambling experience? Are we being realistic?
"
00:15:28,Darryll,"It's definitely a smaller pool than general JavaScript developers, but they're out there. The salary range you mentioned should attract good candidates. The equity and remote flexibility will help too.
"
00:15:45,Mike,"Good to know. Oh, one more thing - they need to pass enhanced background checks. That's a regulatory requirement for anyone working on our gambling platform. Just make sure candidates know that upfront.
"
00:16:00,Darryll,"Will do. I'll get started on the job description and start reaching out to potential candidates. I'll focus on those with betting platform experience first.
"
00:16:12,Mike,"Perfect. Thanks Darryll. Let me know if you need anything else.
"
00:16:18,Darryll,"Will do. Thanks Mike, speak soon.
"
